SQL Queries

1) Want to be able to find all the divers that can go on a certain trip based on cert level
	SELECT D.Name,D.Email,D.DTID From Divers as D Join Dive_trips as DT on D.DTID = DT.DTID WHERE DT.Cert_level_req = D.Cert_level
	
	** We can have the user input a cert level **
	
2) Want to be able to find all the dives where max_depth > 100 and cert_level required is < 3
	SELECT DTID, Location, Max_Depth, Cert_level_req From dive_trips WHERE Max_Depth > 100 and Cert_level_req < 3
	
	** We can have the user input a max depth and cert level to find the dives **

3) Find the dives where the Employee leading the dive has worked for the company for more than 5 years
   SELECT E.E_name, E. Yrs_worked, DT.DTID FROM dive_trips as DT JOIN Employees as E on DT.EID = E.EID WHERE E.Yrs_worked > 5
   
   **We can have the user input a year amount to find a leader who has a lot of experience or not a lot of experience**
   
4) Find all the divers going on a trip (for my case trip 1)
   SELECT DID, Name, Cert_level FROM Divers WHERE DTID = 1
   
   **We can have the user input a DTID number so they can see who is coming with them **
